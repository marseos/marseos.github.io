On the other hand, the process of transmitting messages connects us as a human race. Now, we've come this far, through the Internet, to you. Most people are often connected on the planet, which makes geographical distances smaller in a way. But is it possible to narrow the long distance between planet Earth and the planet Mars following this example? Well, fortunately we can say that technology is growing at a steady pace. It's literally accelerating! So how are we getting to Mars? How can I collect data? How to prepare the planet for the arrival of human beings? For each of these questions, there is an answer. Come with us and learn more about how communication between the planets is and how they are involved with our future. Here you will begin your journey to an interplanetary mission.
